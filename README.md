Header 1

----------------------------------------------

This is my first R Markdown document. I'd like to use *italics* and **bold**.

Here's a list with dashes:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Here's a list with asterisks:
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

Now I'll write some `in-line` code using back-ticks.

```
And a code block display
with fixed-width font
```

> Blockquotes are offset
